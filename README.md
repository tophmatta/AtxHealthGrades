# ATX Health Inspection App

ATX Health Inspection is a mobile app designed to help users access restaurant health inspection grades and scores within the Austin, Texas area. Users can search for health inspection reports by restaurant name or browse nearby restaurants based on proximity/location search using an interactive map. This app connects to the City of Austin's public health data through the Socrata Open Data API, ensuring accurate, up-to-date information directly from the cityâ€™s open database.
